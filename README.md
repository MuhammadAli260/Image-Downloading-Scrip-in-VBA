# Image-Downloading-Scrip-in-VBA
This project uses an Excel VBA script to download images. We need to provide the image URL in an Excel file and this script searches the URL automatically and downloads the image to the provided location in the system.   • We can provide a custom path to save the image • We can select the custom name of the image as well.
